Using the fastq files and the reference created by the cell ranger, you can start running the cell ranger count 
  so that the sequenced RNA reads will be mapped to the custom mm10 genome for evaluating gene expression at the single-cell level.

Due to file size limitations here, we only upload key results files generated by cell ranger count, which will be used for downstream analysis and visualisation.
