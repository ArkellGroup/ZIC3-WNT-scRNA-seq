From the download files, 'genome.fa' and 'genes.gtf.gz' are used in the following Custom Reference building.

And then, add a special Marker gene, GFP, according to the 10x tutorial to the 'genome.fa' and 'genes.gtf.gz' files. 
  The newly added genes will exist as an independent 'chromosome' in the genome. 
  Its existence will not affect the corresponding read mapping of genes other than GFP. 
  Therefore, even if GFP is no longer used in subsequent experiments, there is no need to remove this gene from the reference.
